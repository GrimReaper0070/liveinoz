    <p>________________________________________</p>
    <h2>10. ID verification and sensitive information</h2>
    <p>Some accommodation listings offer a Verified Badge, which requires the advertiser to upload an ID document or similar proof.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We use this information only to perform verification and help reduce scams and fake listings.</li>
        <li>Access to verification documents is restricted to authorised personnel and/or trusted verification providers.</li>
        <li>We do not display your ID documents publicly.</li>
        <li>If you ask us to delete your ID documents, we will do so where legally permitted; removing them may mean the Verified Badge is removed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We generally try not to collect sensitive information (such as health, racial or religious information) unless strictly necessary and with your consent.</p>
    <p>________________________________________</p>
    <h2>11. Security</h2>

    <p>________________________________________</p>

    <p>Our website contains links to third-party websites and platforms, including WhatsApp groups and external services.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>These third parties have their own privacy policies, which you should read carefully.</li>

        <li>Joining a WhatsApp group or other external service is entirely your choice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>________________________________________</p>
    <h2>13. Children</h2>
