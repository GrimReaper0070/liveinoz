    <h3>Verification and "Verified" labels</h3>
    <p>In some areas (for example, accommodation listings) we may show a "Verified Badge" or similar label.</p>

    <li>This normally means the advertiser has provided some basic proof of identity or information that we have checked in a limited way.</li>
    <li>It does not mean that we guarantee:
    <ul>
    <li>that the property has been inspected,</li>
    <li>that the advertiser is completely trustworthy,</li>
    <li>that the price or conditions are fair, or</li>
    <li>that there is no risk.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You must still exercise your own judgment and caution, including inspections, written agreements, and independent checks.</p>
